# User Interface

This repository contains the user interface and some configuration features for a biomedical rehabilitation device prototype. The Gui was developed using Qt and PyQt libraries, the data was store using Sequence Query Language - SQL.

The main goal of this project was to generate a system for the implementation of rehabilitation procedures, especifically the hold-relax technique in elbow rehabilitation. The core of the mechanical prototype was an odrive board to control a brushless motor that moves the mechanism, so these files referred to odrive libraries.

This development of a system for the assistance in rehabilitation was part of my undergraduate Thesis.
